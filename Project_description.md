The **Demographic Data Analyzer** repository contains a Python project to analyze demographic data from a dataset. This project is part of FreeCodeCampâ€™s **Data Analysis with Python** course. It calculates key statistics, such as race count, average age, education levels, and more, using the `pandas` library for efficient data manipulation.

### Key Features:
1. **Data Analysis**:
   - Calculate statistics like race distribution, average age of men, and percentage of individuals with higher education.
  
2. **Advanced Metrics**:
   - Determine the percentage of people earning more than $50K, grouped by education level.
  
3. **Efficient Data Handling**:
   - Uses `pandas` to filter, group, and manipulate data for quick and effective analysis.
  
4. **Tests Included**:
   - Includes unit tests to validate the correctness of the calculations.
  
5. **Modular Design**:
   - Functions are modular, making the code easy to extend and maintain.

This project enhances proficiency in working with real-world datasets and extracting meaningful insights.
